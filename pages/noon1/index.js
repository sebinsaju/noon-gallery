        <p>
          Arabic script calligraphy is the art of beautiful writing, using the
          letters of the Arabic alphabet. This art form is also known as Islamic
          calligraphy, because it was first developed to write the Quranâ€”the
          holy book of Islam. Calligraphy is one of the highest forms of visual
          art in the Islamic world. Today, this art form is practiced and
          enjoyed by people from many different countries and religions. There
          are many different styles of Arabic calligraphy.

        <h5 className="mb-3">How can I help you?</h5>
        <p>
          I practice traditional and contemporary Arabic calligraphy, and do
          custom calligraphy design on stone, walls, paper and digital mediums
          for original pieces, weddings, homes, mosques, plaques, headstones and
          more. All my work is hand-written and crafted, I also use computer
          fonts in my designs. I scan the finished product into CorelDRAW, where
          it can be turned into a vectorized transparency so your artists can
          drop it in seamlessly with very little editing required on your end.
          If you need Arabic calligraphy-related graphic design, Stone
          engraving, Glass etching works, Wood/Multiwood design, Metal Design,
          Sticker works, Flex design, Name Boards, logo work, branding, or other
          calligraphic and design elements for your product, I am happy to help.
          Here are a few things I&apos;ve been working on lately.
